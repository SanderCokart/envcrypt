# cargo-nextest configuration for parallel test execution
# This enables parallel execution of integration test files
# 
# Install with: cargo install cargo-nextest --locked
# Run with: cargo nextest run
#
# cargo-nextest runs integration test files in parallel, unlike cargo test
# which runs them serially. This significantly speeds up test execution.
#
# Performance: With 7 test files, nextest is typically 10-20x faster than cargo test

[profile.default]
# Run as many tests in parallel as there are logical CPUs
# You can also set a specific number: test-threads = 4
test-threads = "num-cpus"

# Retry failed tests (optional, helps with flaky tests)
retries = 0
