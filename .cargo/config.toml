# Note: Cargo runs integration test files SERIALLY by default.
# To run integration tests in parallel, use cargo-nextest:
#   cargo install cargo-nextest
#   cargo nextest run
#
# Alternatively, you can combine all tests into a single file with modules,
# but that defeats the purpose of feature-based organization.
